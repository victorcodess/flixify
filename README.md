## My process

### Built with

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Next.js
- Next Auth
- Prisma
- PostgreSQL
- React Hook Form

### What I learned

This was the first time I worked on a full-stack web application, so I got learn a lot about interacting with databases. I built the UI from the Figma file, and implemented all of the functionalities using ```Next.js``` and ```Tailwind CSS.``` I learnt how to use ```Prisma``` to interact with both a local ```sqlite``` database and a deployed ```postgresql``` database. I also learnt how to implement user authentication with custom log-in/sign-up pages using ```next auth.``` I learnt how to use ```react hook form``` to manage form data and validate the form values. I also learnt how to implement a theme switch using ```Tailwind CSS``` and ```next-theme.``` In all, this was a great learning experience for me as a frontend engineer.

### Continued development

I still intend on continuing this project and expanding on some of it's features. I plan on adding an external movie API, as I'm currently making use of a dummy local JSON file. Then I would include some other features like watching videos and seeing more details about the movies.

### Useful resources

- [Full Stack Authentication with Next-Auth and Next.js 13: All You Need to Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eu4_lLFkGk&t=527s) - This helped me while implementing the Authentication for the web app. I'd recommend it to anyone trying to laern authentication with Next Auth.
